# This code selection contains two parts: an HTML webpage and a lyrics generator app.
# To access the webpage, the user can simply run the live server for the HTML.
# However, the lyrics generator is not well integrated on the webpage and needs to be run separately. Please see the corresponding folder. You may also run the generator in local host and then upload the server link to the script.js.
# Note that the host and API URL may change since the server is run in real-time during presentation.
# If the user encounters an error, we are happy to assist and will provide an updated server link.
